This treaty was brought about due to increased hunting of polar bears during the 1960s and 1970s which led to polar bears being under severe survival pressure from hunters .   The agreement prohibits random , unregulated sport hunting of polar bears and outlaws hunting of polar bears from aircraft and icebreakers which have been the most detrimental to the polar bear population . Additionally , the agreement holds member states accountable for taking appropriate actions to protect the ecosystems of which the polar bears dwell , paying special attention to places where polar bears create dens , do a majority of their feeding , and where they migrate . States also must manage polar bear populations in accordance with proper conservation practices based on the best available scientific data .   According to the agreement the killing of polar bears is only warranted for bona fide scientific purposes , to prevent serious disturbances of other living resources such as human populations , and by local people using traditional methods in the realm of their traditional rights in accordance with the laws of that party . Yet the skins or any other items of value that are taken as a result of the killing of a polar bear can not be used for commercial purposes . Also important to this agreement is that member states must prohibit the exportation , importation , and trafficking of polar bears within their states . These nations share their polar bear research findings and meet every three to four years to coordinate their research on polar bears throughout the Arctic . This agreement was one of the first of its kind and continues to be successful today in the international conservation of polar bears .'}"

       "   'document': \"The polar bear ( ursus #Latin maritimus #Latin ) is a carnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle , encompassing the Arctic Ocean , its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses . It is a large bear , approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear ( Ursus arctos middendorffi ) . A boar ( adult male ) weighs around 350 -- , while a sow ( adult female ) is about half that size . Although it is the sister species of the brown bear , it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche , with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures , for moving across snow , ice and open water , and for hunting seals , which make up most of its diet . Although most polar bears are born on land , they spend most of their time on the sea ice . Their scientific name means `` maritime bear '' and derives from this fact . Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice , often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present . Because of their dependence on the sea ice , polar bears are classified as marine mammals ; an alternative basis for classification as marine mammals is that they depend on the ocean as their main food source .   Because of expected habitat loss caused by climate change , the polar bear is classified as a vulnerable species , and at least three of the nineteen polar bear subpopulations are currently in decline . For decades , large-scale hunting raised international concern for the future of the species , but populations rebounded after controls and quotas began to take effect . For thousands of years , the polar bear has been a key figure in the material , spiritual , and cultural life of circumpolar peoples , and polar bears remain important in their cultures .\"},\n",

Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs , long snouts , small rounded ears , shaggy hair , plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws , and short tails .   While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous , and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo , the remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets . With the exception of courting individuals and mothers with their young , bears are typically solitary animals . They may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an excellent sense of smell . Despite their heavy build and awkward gait , they are adept runners , climbers , and swimmers . Bears use shelters , such as caves and logs , as their dens ; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of hibernation , up to 100 days .   Bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur ; they have been used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment , such as being made to dance . With their powerful physical presence , they play a prominent role in the arts , mythology , and other cultural aspects of various human societies . In modern times , bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts , including the Asian bile bear market .

This treaty was brought about due to increased hunting of polar bears during the 1960s and 1970s which led to polar bears being under severe survival pressure from hunters .   The agreement prohibits random , unregulated sport hunting of polar bears and outlaws hunting of polar bears from aircraft and icebreakers which have been the most detrimental to the polar bear population . Additionally , the agreement holds member states accountable for taking appropriate actions to protect the ecosystems of which the polar bears dwell , paying special attention to places where polar bears create dens , do a majority of their feeding , and where they migrate . States also must manage polar bear populations in accordance with proper conservation practices based on the best available scientific data .   According to the agreement the killing of polar bears is only warranted for bona fide scientific purposes , to prevent serious disturbances of other living resources such as human populations , and by local people using traditional methods in the realm of their traditional rights in accordance with the laws of that party . Yet the skins or any other items of value that are taken as a result of the killing of a polar bear can not be used for commercial purposes . Also important to this agreement is that member states must prohibit the exportation , importation , and trafficking of polar bears within their states . These nations share their polar bear research findings and meet every three to four years to coordinate their research on polar bears throughout the Arctic . This agreement was one of the first of its kind and continues to be successful today in the international conservation of polar bears .'},\n",

In modern times they have been favoured by big game hunters due to their size and ferocity . Bear hunting has a vast history throughout Europe and North America and hunting practices have varied based on location and type of bear as well as the legal situation as some bears are protected . There are various methods of bear hunting including poisoning , shooting and stabbing .   Bears are large mammals in the order Carnivora . Although there are only eight living species of bear , they are widespread , appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere . The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered , and even `` least concern '' species such as the brown bear are at risk of extirpation in certain countries .

Because of their imposing size , elusiveness , sharp senses , and ferocity , bears are among the most favoured big game animals . Where they are hunted frequently , bears become purely nocturnal .   Bears have the ability to dramatically lower their heart rate when hibernating and will readily do so if injured , as a defense mechanism against blood loss . Hunters carrying firearms tend to favour calibres large enough to inflict as much tissue and bone damage as possible , as grizzly and brown bears can generally withstand a number of direct shots to the limbs or torso without ceasing their attack . To successfully subdue a bear by firearm , one may have to shoot it several times , so as to leave wounds that will cause the bear to hemorrhage to death as quickly as possible . Hunters pursuing the animal deliberately might use a caliber larger than they would for the deer that commonly co-inhabit the same area . If they intend to keep the hide , and to ensure a quick and humane kill , they may prefer to use a large bullet that will break the bear 's shoulder and continue through the vital organs , ideally leaving an exit wound large enough to leave a blood trail to assist locating the downed animal . For these reasons , bears are hard to hunt , as they generally live in dense forests or thick brush . They are , however , easy to trap .   Once a general area is identified , a bear hunt usually begins by looking for claw marks on trees . Scores in bear hunts are based on the width and length of the skull .\"},\n",

       "   'document': \"Global warming , also referred to as climate change , is the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth 's climate system and its related effects . Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming . Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented in the instrumental temperature record which extends back to the mid 19th century , and in paleoclimate proxy records over thousands of years .   In 2013 , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) Fifth Assessment Report concluded that `` It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century . '' The largest human influence has been emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide . Climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to for their lowest emissions scenario and 2.6 to for the highest emissions scenario . These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing .   Future climate change and associated impacts will differ from region to region around the globe . Anticipated effects include warming global temperature , rising sea levels , changing precipitation , and expansion of deserts in the subtropics . Warming is expected to be greater over land than over the oceans and greatest in the Arctic , with the continuing retreat of glaciers , permafrost and sea ice . Other likely changes include more frequent extreme weather events including heat waves , droughts , heavy rainfall with floods and heavy snowfall ; ocean acidification ; and species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes . Effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields and the abandonment of populated areas due to rising sea levels . Because the climate system has a large `` inertia '' and greenhouse gases will stay in the atmosphere for a long time , many of these effects will not only exist for decades or centuries , but will persist for tens of thousands of years .   Possible societal responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction , adaptation to its effects , building systems resilient to its effects , and possible future climate engineering . Most countries are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) ,  whose ultimate objective is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change . Parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required and that global warming should be limited to well below 2.0 C-change relative to pre-industrial levels , with efforts made to limit warming to 1.5 C-change .   Public reactions to global warming and concern about its effects are also increasing . A global 2015 Pew Research Center report showed a median of 54 % consider it `` a very serious problem '' . There are significant regional differences , with Americans and Chinese ( whose economies are responsible for the greatest annual CO2 emissions ) among the least concerned .\"},\n",

Towards the end of the Pleistocene era ( roughly 13,000 to 10,000 years ago ) , nearly all megafauna of Europe , as well as South , Central and North America , dwindled towards extinction , in what has been referred to as the Quaternary extinction event .

The media widely reported this as the `` death of 150,000 penguins . '' in Antarctica . The iceberg was the size of Rome , measuring 1,120 square miles . The Adélie penguins there face being wiped out after iceberg became lodged in their bay . In an article in Antarctic Science , researchers wrote : `` The arrival of iceberg B09B in Commonwealth Bay , East Antarctica , and subsequent fast ice expansion has dramatically increased the distance Adélie penguins breeding at Cape Denison must travel in search of food '' .   The authors released this update : `` It is important to recognise that this study focuses on the Adélie penguin colonies at Cape Denison and the MacKellar Islets , which has been well known , and importantly , well studied over the past century . The study reported here identified that the impact of the iceberg B09B on the penguins since 2010 . The number of penguins breeding at these colonies has declined markedly since estimates were first made 100 years ago . However our study concerns only the impact B09B and the associated fast ice that has built up between it and the land since the iceberg stranded in 2010 . The penguins now have to commute about 65 km between colonies where they breed and the sea where they can feed . Many fewer penguins are now returning to the colonies to attempt to breed and of those that do return most fail to rear their chicks . We found hundreds of abandoned eggs and thousands of dead chicks . We did not suggest that thousands of adult penguins have died as some media reports suggest . In fact it is unlikely many if any adult penguins have died as a result of this stranding event . We found very few , perhaps no pre-breeding birds at Cape Denison and , if as we predict , few if any young birds prospecting for a place to breed in future are visiting these colonies the local colonies could become extinct within the breeding life of an Adelie penguins ( < 16 years ) if young birds do not replace the old established breeders as they come to the end of their lives . ''   `` This iceberg stranding event only affects Adelie penguins in the Commonwealth Bay area , the millions of Adelie penguins breeding around the rest of Antarctica are not affected . ''   This report was subsequently disputed and corrected by Antarctic experts who regretted the dramatic tone used by the journalists that led to over-simplification in the interpretation of the iceberg effect . The penguins that could not be found on the colony blocked by the iceberg are not dead . They probably relocated elsewhere in search of a new place to breed .

Hibernation refers to a season of heterothermy that is characterized by low body temperature , slow breathing and heart rate , and low metabolic rate . Although traditionally reserved for `` deep '' hibernators such as rodents , the term has been redefined to include animals such as bears and is now applied based on active metabolic suppression rather than based on absolute body temperature decline . Many experts believe that the processes of daily torpor and hibernation form a continuum and utilize similar mechanisms . The equivalent during the summer months is known as aestivation . Some reptile species ( ectotherms ) are said to brumate , or undergo brumation , but any possible similarities between brumation and hibernation are not firmly established . Some insects , such as the wasp Polistes exclamans , hibernate by aggregating together in groups in protected places called hibernacula .   Often associated with low temperatures , the function of hibernation is to conserve energy during a period when sufficient food is unavailable . To achieve this energy saving , an endotherm will first decrease its metabolic rate , which then decreases body temperature . Hibernation may last several days , weeks , or months depending on the species , ambient temperature , time of year , and individual 's body condition .   Before entering hibernation , animals need to store enough energy to last through the entire winter . Larger species become hyperphagic and eat a large amount of food and store the energy in fat deposits . In many small species , food caching replaces eating and becoming fat . Some species of mammals hibernate while gestating young , which are either born while the mother hibernates or shortly afterwards .   For example , the female polar bear goes into hibernation during the cold winter months to give birth to her offspring . She loses 15 -- 27 % of her pre-hibernation weight and uses stored fats for energy during times of food scarcity , or hibernation . It is evident that pregnant female polar bears significantly increase body mass prior to hibernation , and this increase is further reflected in the weight of their offspring . The fat accumulation prior to hibernation in female polar bears enables them to provide a sufficient and warm , nurturing environment for their newborns .\"},\n",

Estimates on the number of Earth 's current species range from 2 million to 1012 , of which about 1.6 million have been databased thus far and over 80 percent have not yet been described . More recently , in May 2016 , scientists reported that 1 trillion species are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described . The total amount of DNA base pairs on Earth , as a possible approximation of global biodiversity , is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 , and weighs 50 billion tonnes . In comparison , the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 TtC ( trillion tons of carbon ) .   In other related studies , around 1.9 million extant species are believed to have been described currently , but some scientists believe 20 % are synonyms , reducing the total valid described species to 1.5 million . In 2013 , a study published in Science estimated there to be 5 ± 3 million extant species on Earth . Another study , published in 2011 by PLoS Biology , estimated there to be 8.7 million ± 1.3 million eukaryotic species on Earth . Some 250,000 valid fossil species have been described , but this is believed to be a small proportion of all species that have ever lived .   Global biodiversity is affected by extinction and speciation . The background extinction rate varies among taxa but it is estimated that there is approximately one extinction per million species years . Mammal species , for example , typically persist for 1 million years . Biodiversity has grown and shrunk in earth 's past due to ( presumably ) abiotic factors such as extinction events caused by geologically rapid changes in climate . Climate change 299 million years ago was one such event . A cooling and drying resulted in catastrophic rainforest collapse and subsequently a great loss of diversity , especially of amphibians .  However , the current rate and magnitude of extinctions are much higher than background estimates .

The race is held in the last decade of November along Hudson Bay shore in extremely cold weather .   The organizer of the Polar Bear Marathon is Albert Martens , a native of Steinbach , Manitoba , which is situated some 1000 km south of Churchill . Martens is a seasoned marathon runner who himself has participated in around 60 marathon and ultramarathon races , including Badwater Ultramarathon in Death Valley , California . Martens came to the idea of marathon race in particularly challenging cold weather after running a marathon race at -32 ° C in 2011 .   The challenge of the selected race route is related not only to tough weather ( during 2013 race the temperatures dropped to -20 ° C , or -41 ° with wind chill , while the runners in 2012 were `` disappointed '' by milder temperatures between -10 ° and -20 ° ) , but also to the abundance of polar bears in its vicinity . Churchill is considered `` the Polar Bear capital of the world '' , and during late fall they board fresh sea ice to hunt for seals . Not long before the date of the first race , November 20 , 2012 , news have spread about bear attacks in Churchill . Although race organizers consider a bear attack on runners unlikely , the participants run in pairs , to which they are assigned according to their pace running times , and each pair is escorted by a truck carrying food , extra clothing and emergency equipment including rifles .   While the winners of the Polar Bear Marathon are awarded only symbolic prizes such as medals , stuffed polar bears and soapstone figurines by a local sculptor , the participation in the race costs them significant money . For the flights from Winnipeg to Churchill and back , three nights ' hotel stay and sightseeing trip in the day following the race , the participants are expected to pay around $ 2,500 .   The number of competitors in the Polar Bear Marathon was initially restricted by the organizers to 20 , but for first three events even this proved to be a high estimate . In the 2012 race 14 runners from 3 countries ( Canada , U.S. and Germany ) took part while only 13 athletes ran the 2013 race ( only in 2015 the number of participants exceeded 20 , reaching 24 ) .

First , the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic drift would generate a cordon of warm water around the North Pole , which in turn , holds in a frozen mass of Arctic air .  Second , if the North Atlantic drift were to shut down , that barrier would fail , releasing a flood of frozen air into the Northern Hemisphere , causing a sudden and drastic temperature shift .   The book discusses a possible cause of the failure of the Gulf Stream : the melting of the polar ice caps could drastically affect the salinity of the North Atlantic drift by dumping a large quantity of freshwater into the world 's oceans .   Bell and Strieber explain the possibility that such current destabilizations have occurred before , as well as seemingly impossible engineering feats by the ancients . Among their examples is the island city of Nan Madol . The book claims that its construction , with exacting tolerances and extremely heavy basalt materials , necessitates a high degree of technical competency . Since no such society exists in the modern record or even , in legend , the society must have been destroyed by dramatic means .   While other explanations beside a global meteorological event are possible , a correlating evidence set is presented in the woolly mammoth . Strieber and Bell assert that since mammoths have been found preserved with food still in their mouths and undigested in their stomachs , these animals must have been killed quickly , in otherwise normal conditions . They were preserved so well by quick freezing , which is taken as evidence of a rapid onset of a global blizzard or similar event .   Interspersed with the analytical parts of the book are a series of interlinked short fictional scenarios , written in italics , describing what might transpire today if a destabilization of the North Atlantic Current were to occur . The fictional accounts of `` current events '' as the meteorological situation deteriorates provided background and inspiration for the 2004 science fiction film The Day After Tomorrow .

These include the chemistry at Earth 's surface , the rate of cooling of the planet 's interior , the gravitational interactions with other objects in the Solar System , and a steady increase in the Sun 's luminosity . An uncertain factor in this extrapolation is the ongoing influence of technology introduced by humans , such as climate engineering , which could cause significant changes to the planet . The current Holocene extinction is being caused by technology and the effects may last for up to five million years . In turn , technology may result in the extinction of humanity , leaving the planet to gradually return to a slower evolutionary pace resulting solely from long-term natural processes .   Over time intervals of hundreds of millions of years , random celestial events pose a global risk to the biosphere , which can result in mass extinctions . These include impacts by comets or asteroids with diameters of 5 -- or more , and the possibility of a massive stellar explosion , called a supernova , within a 100-light-year radius of the Sun , called a Near-Earth supernova . Other large-scale geological events are more predictable . If the long-term effects of global warming are disregarded , Milankovitch theory predicts that the planet will continue to undergo glacial periods at least until the Quaternary glaciation comes to an end . These periods are caused by variations in eccentricity , axial tilt , and precession of the Earth 's orbit . As part of the ongoing supercontinent cycle , plate tectonics will probably result in a supercontinent in 250 -- 350 million years . Some time in the next 1.5 -- 4.5 billion years , the axial tilt of the Earth may begin to undergo chaotic variations , with changes in the axial tilt of up to 90 ° .   During the next four billion years , the luminosity of the Sun will steadily increase , resulting in a rise in the solar radiation reaching the Earth . This will result in a higher rate of weathering of silicate minerals , which will cause a decrease in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere . In about 600 million years from now , the level of CO2 will fall below the level needed to sustain C3 carbon fixation photosynthesis used by trees . Some plants use the C4 carbon fixation method , allowing them to persist at concentrations as low as 10 parts per million . However , the long-term trend is for plant life to die off altogether . The extinction of plants will be the demise of almost all animal life , since plants are the base of the food chain on Earth .   In about one billion years , the solar luminosity will be 10 % higher than at present . This will cause the atmosphere to become a `` moist greenhouse '' , resulting in a runaway evaporation of the oceans . As a likely consequence , plate tectonics will come to an end , and with them the entire carbon cycle . Following this event , in about 2 − 3 billion years , the planet 's magnetic dynamo may cease , causing the magnetosphere to decay and leading to an accelerated loss of volatiles from the outer atmosphere . Four billion years from now , the increase in the Earth 's surface temperature will cause a runaway greenhouse effect , heating the surface enough to melt it . By that point , all life on the Earth will be extinct . The most probable fate of the planet is absorption by the Sun in about 7.5 billion years , after the star has entered the red giant phase and expanded to cross the planet 's current orbit .\"},\n",

       "   'document': 'The retreat of glaciers since 1850 affects the availability of fresh water for irrigation and domestic use , mountain recreation , animals and plants that depend on glacier-melt , and , in the longer term , the level of the oceans . Studied by glaciologists , the temporal coincidence of glacier retreat with the measured increase of atmospheric greenhouse gases is often cited as an evidentiary underpinning of global warming . Mid-latitude mountain ranges such as the Himalayas , Alps , Rocky Mountains , Cascade Range , and the southern Andes , as well as isolated tropical summits such as Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa , are showing some of the largest proportionate glacial losses .   Glacier mass balance is the key determinant of the health of a glacier . If the amount of frozen precipitation in the accumulation zone exceeds the quantity of glacial ice lost due to melting or in the ablation zone a glacier will advance ; if the accumulation is less than the ablation , the glacier will retreat . Glaciers in retreat will have negative mass balances , and if they do not find an equilibrium between accumulation and ablation , will eventually disappear .   The Little Ice Age was a period from about 1550 to 1850 when the world experienced relatively cooler temperatures compared to the present . Subsequently , until about 1940 , glaciers around the world retreated as the climate warmed substantially . Glacial retreat slowed and even reversed temporarily , in many cases , between 1950 and 1980 as global temperatures cooled slightly . Since 1980 , a significant global warming has led to glacier retreat becoming increasingly rapid and ubiquitous , so much so that some glaciers have disappeared altogether , and the existences of many of the remaining glaciers are threatened . In locations such as the Andes of South America and Himalayas in Asia , the demise of glaciers in these regions has the potential to affect water supplies in those areas .   The retreat of mountain glaciers , notably in western North America , Asia , the Alps and tropical and subtropical regions of South America , Africa and Indonesia , provide evidence for the rise in global temperatures since the late 19th century . The acceleration of the rate of retreat since 1995 of key outlet glaciers of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets may foreshadow a rise in sea level , which would affect coastal regions .'},\n",

The best known example of this is the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse which occurred 350 million years ago . This event decimated amphibian populations and spurred on the evolution of reptiles .   Climate change is a natural event that has occurred throughout history . However , with the recent increased emission of CO2 in the Earth 's atmosphere , abrupt climate change has occurred . It has been hypothesized that anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing has significantly influenced global climate since about 8000 before present ( Van Hoof 2006 ) .   Animals have had specific responses to climate change . Species respond to climate changes by migration , adaptation , or if neither of those occur , death . These migrations can sometimes follow an animal 's preferred temperature , elevation , soil , etc. , as said terrain moves due to climate change . Adaptation can be either genetic or phenological , and death can occur in a local population only ( extirpation ) or as an entire species , otherwise known as extinction .   Climate changes is projected to affect individual organisms , populations , species distributions and ecosystem composition and function both directly ( ex . Increased temperatures and changes in precipitation ) and indirectly ( through climate changing the intensity and frequency of disturbances such as wildfires and severe storms ) ( IPCC 2002 ) .   Every organism has a unique set of preferences or requirements , a niche and biodiversity has been tied to the diversity of animals ' niches . These can include or be affected by temperature , aridity , resource availability , habitat requirements , enemies , soil characteristics , competitors , and pollinators . Since the factors that compose a niche can be so complex and interconnected , the niches of many animals are bound to be affected by climate change ( Parmesan Yohe 2003 ) .   One study done by Camille Parmesan and Gary Yohe from University of Texas , Austin shows the global fingerprint of climate change on natural systems . The results of their global analysis of 334 species were recorded to demonstrate the correlation of patterns consistent with global climate change of the 20th century . Using the IPCC 's ( Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ) ` levels of confidence ' , this study proved significant nonrandom behavioral changes due to global climate change with very high confidence ( > 95 ) . Furthermore , an accuracy of 74-91 % change in species has displayed predicted change for species in response to climate change .\"},\n",

The project is being led by Russian scientist Sergey Zimov , with hopes to back the hypothesis that overhunting , and not climate change , was primarily responsible for the extinction of wildlife and the disappearance of the grasslands at the end of the Pleistocene epoch .   A further aim is to research the climatic effects of the expected changes in the ecosystem . Here the hypothesis is that the change from tundra to grassland will result in a raised ratio of energy emission to energy absorption of the area , leading to less thawing of permafrost and thereby less emission of greenhouse gases .   To study this , large herbivores have been released , and their effect on the local fauna is being monitored . Preliminary results point at the ecologically low-grade tundra biome being converted into a productive grassland biome , and at the energy emission of the area being raised .   A documentary is being produced about the park by an American journalist and filmmaker .   For 2017 the acquisition of herds of bison and domestic yak is being planned . The money for acquisition , transport and care of the animals has already been successfully raised through a crowdfunding campaign earlier this year .'},\n",

This was a time of major climatic change , especially cooling , not obviously linked with any single major impact or any catastrophic volcanic event . One cause of the extinction event is speculated to be extended volcanic activity . Another speculation is that the extinctions are related to several large meteorite impacts that occurred about this time . One such event caused the Chesapeake Bay impact crater ( 40 km ) , and another at the Popigai crater ( 100 km ) of central Siberia , scattering debris perhaps as far as Europe . New dating of the Popigai meteor suggests it may be a cause of the mass extinction .   A leading scientific theory on climate cooling at this time is decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide , which slowly declined in the mid to late Eocene and possibly reached some threshold approximately 34 million years ago . This boundary is closely linked with the Oligocene Oi-1 event , an oxygen isotope excursion that marks the beginning of ice sheet coverage on Antarctica .'},\n",

The studies summarized , which date back to the cutoff point of the Working Group 1 Report , are those that authors viewed most relevant to the discussions at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference .

Human-induced warming  Studies conducted by Lee and Rind show that only 10 % of global warming over the past century was due to the Sun .  Acceleration of melting ice caps  Glaciers and melting ice caps can contribute to about 8/10ths of a meter to global sea level rise .  Rapid Arctic sea-ice decline  According to simulations run by NCAR Climate System Model version 3 , the Arctic summer is expected to be ice-free by 2040 .  Underestimation of changing sea levels  In contrast to previous IPCC , the rate of sea level rise ( 3.4 mm/yr over the past 15 years ) has increased around 80 % faster than previously predicted .  Damage due to inaction  A region of permafrost , called the Yedoma , stores about 500 Gt of CO2 and , once released due to rising global temperatures , will increase global temperatures even more .  Turning point must come soon  The largest climate science conference , held in 2009 , has stated , `` Temperature rises above 2 ° C will be difficult for contemporary societies to cope with , and are likely to cause major societal and environmental disruptions through the rest of the century and beyond .

In order to find answers for these problems , researchers study the various factors that impact reefs . The list of factors is long , including the ocean 's role as a carbon dioxide sink , atmospheric changes , ultraviolet light , ocean acidification , viruses , impacts of dust storms carrying agents to far-flung reefs , pollutants , algal blooms and others . Reefs are threatened well beyond coastal areas .   In 2008 estimates assembled from coral reef specialists from around the world indicated that 19 % of the existing area of coral reefs has already been lost , and that a further 17 % is likely to be lost over the subsequent 10 -- 20 years .

Coral Reef loss has been cause for concern for a long time , but is now starting to gain traction as one of the worlds greatest environmental threats . The current greatest threat to the reefs are coral bleaching , which is the loss of the endosymbiotic algae from the coral ( the thing that gives coral it 's vibrant color ) due to rising ocean water temperatures . Some other threats that are not as prominent but still play a factor to the loss of the world 's reefs are poisonous fishing practices , explosive fishing practices , careless tourism , and pollution . The loss of the coral reefs will come with consequences such as human vulnerability , environmental chaos , and a massive , relatively unseen , economic cost .\"},\n",

From a standpoint of environmental scepticism , Booker seeks to combine an analysis of the science of global warming with the consequences of political decisions to reduce emissions and claims that , as governments prepare to make radical changes in energy policies , the scientific evidence for global warming is becoming increasingly challenged . He asserts that global warming is not supported by a significant number of climate scientists , and criticises how the UN 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) presents evidence and data , in particular citing its reliance on potentially inaccurate global climate models to make temperature projections . Booker concludes , `` it begins to look very possible that the nightmare vision of our planet being doomed '' may be imaginary , and that , if so , `` it will turn out to be one of the most expensive , destructive , and foolish mistakes the human race has ever made '' .   The book 's claims were strongly criticised by science writer Philip Ball , but the book was praised by several columnists . The book opens with an erroneous quotation , which Booker subsequently acknowledged and promised to correct in future editions .

WCR says of itself :   World Climate Report , a concise , hard-hitting and scientifically correct response to the global change reports which gain attention in the literature and popular press . As the nation 's leading publication in this realm , World Climate Report is exhaustively researched , impeccably referenced , and always timely . This popular biweekly newsletter points out the weaknesses and outright fallacies in the science that is being touted as `` proof '' of disastrous warming . It 's the perfect antidote against those who argue for proposed changes to the Rio Climate Treaty , such as the Kyoto Protocol , which are aimed at limiting carbon emissions from the United States ... World Climate Report has become the definitive and unimpeachable source for what nature now calls the `` mainstream skeptic '' point of view . .   In addition to Patrick Michaels ( chief editor ) , the staff is listed as Robert C. Balling , Jr ( contributing editor ) , Robert Davis ( contributing editor ) , and Paul Knappenberger ( Administrator ) .   New Hope Environmental Services , an advocacy science consulting firm , claims WCR as its biweekly newsletter .\"},\n",

They became extinct 30 ± 5 thousand years ago . Many other species became extinct in Australia around that time , coinciding with the arrival of humans . Their closest living relatives are fowl .   Two main theories propose a cause for megafauna extinction - human impact and climate change . A study has been performed in which more than 700 Genyornis eggshell fragments were dated . Through this , it was determined that Genyornis declined and became extinct over a short period -- too short for it to be plausibly explained by climate change . The authors considered this to be a very good indication that the entire mass extinction event in Australia was due to human activity , rather than climate change . A 2015 study collected egg shell fragments of Genyornis from around 200 sites that show burn marks . Analysis of amino acids in the egg shells showed a thermal gradient consistent with the egg being placed on an ember fire . The egg shells were dated to between 53.9 and 43.4 thousand years before present , suggesting that humans were collecting and cooking Genyornis eggs in the thousands of years before their extinction . A later study , however , suggests that the eggs actually belogned to Progura , a genus of giant megapodes .   In May 2010 , archaeologists announced the rediscovery of an Aboriginal rock art painting , possibly 40,000 years old , at the Nawarla Gabarnmung rock art site in the Northern Territory , that depicts two of the birds in detail .

       "   'document': \"The Holocene extinction , otherwise referred to as the Sixth extinction or Anthropocene extinction , is the ongoing extinction event of species during the present Holocene epoch , mainly due to human activity . The large number of extinctions spans numerous families of plants and animals , including mammals , birds , amphibians , reptiles and arthropods . With widespread degradation of highly biodiverse habitats such as coral reefs and rainforest , as well as other areas , the vast majority of these extinctions is thought to be undocumented . According to the species-area theory , and based on upper-bound estimating , the present rate of extinction may be up to 140,000 species per year , making it the greatest loss of biodiversity since the Cretaceous -- Paleogene extinction event .   The Holocene extinction includes the disappearance of large land animals known as megafauna , starting at the end of the last Ice Age . Megafauna outside of the African continent , which did not evolve alongside humans , proved highly sensitive to the introduction of new predation , and many died out shortly after early humans began spreading and hunting across the Earth ( additionally , many African species have also gone extinct in the Holocene ) . These extinctions , occurring near the Pleistocene -- Holocene boundary , are sometimes referred to as the Quaternary extinction event .   The arrival of humans on different continents coincides with megafaunal extinction . The most popular theory is that human overhunting of species added to existing stress conditions . Although there is debate regarding how much human predation affected their decline , certain population declines have been directly correlated with human activity , such as the extinction events of New Zealand and Hawaii . Aside from humans , climate change may have been a driving factor in the megafaunal extinctions , especially at the end of the Quaternary .   The ecology of humanity has been noted as being that of an unprecedented `` global superpredator '' that regularly preys on the adults of other apex predators and has worldwide effects on food webs . Extinctions of species have occurred on every land mass and ocean , with many famous examples within Africa , Asia , Europe , Australia , North and South America , and on smaller islands . Overall , the Holocene extinction can be characterized by the human impact on the environment . The Holocene extinction continues into the 21st century , with meat consumption , overfishing , ocean acidification and the amphibian crisis being a few broader examples of an almost universal , cosmopolitan decline in biodiversity . A ballooning human population along with profligate consumption are considered to be the primary drivers of this rapid decline .\"},\n",

The sea otter was once abundant in a wide arc across the North Pacific ocean , from northern Japan to Alaska to Mexico . By 1911 , hunting for the animal 's luxurious fur had reduced the sea otter population to fewer than 2000 individuals in the most remote and inaccessible parts of its range .   During the 20th century , sea otter populations recovered from remnant populations in the far east of Russia , western Alaska , and California . Beginning in the 1960s , efforts to translocate sea otters to previously populated areas were also successful in restoring sea otters to other parts of the west coast of North America . Populations in some areas are now thriving , and the recovery of the sea otter is considered one of the greatest successes in marine conservation .   In two important parts of its range , however , sea otter populations have recently declined or have plateaued at depressed levels . In the Aleutian Islands , a massive and unexpected disappearance of sea otters has occurred in recent decades . The cause of the decline is not known , although the observed pattern of disappearances is consistent with a rise in orca predation . Sea otters give live birth . In the 1990s , California 's sea otter population stopped growing for reasons that are probably different from the difficulties facing Alaska 's otters . A high prevalence of infectious disease in juveniles and adults has been found to cause many sea otter deaths , however it is not known why California sea otters would be more vulnerable to disease than populations elsewhere . Other threats to sea otters are well-known . In particular , sea otters are highly vulnerable to oil spills , and a major spill can rapidly kill thousands of the animals . The IUCN lists the sea otter as an endangered species .\"},\n",

Polar deserts are located in the Arctic and Antarctic . Unlike the tundra that can support plant and animal life in the summer , polar deserts are barren with permanent layers of ice .

Temperature changes in polar deserts frequently cross the freezing point of water . This `` freeze-thaw '' alternation forms patterned textures on the ground , as much as 5 m in diameter ( as seen in the picture on the right ) .   Most of the interior of Antarctica is polar desert , despite the thick ice cover .

They include animals such as seals , whales , manatees , sea otters and polar bears . They do not represent a distinct taxon or systematic grouping , but rather have a polyphyletic relation due to convergent evolution . They are also unified by their reliance on the marine environment for feeding .   Marine mammal adaptation to an aquatic lifestyle vary considerably between species . Both cetaceans and sirenians are fully aquatic and therefore are obligate water dwellers . Seals and sea-lions are semiaquatic ; they spend the majority of their time in the water , but need to return to land for important activities such as mating , breeding and molting . In contrast , both otters and the polar bear are much less adapted to aquatic living . Their diet varies considerably as well ; some may eat zooplankton , others may eat fish , squid , shellfish , sea-grass and a few may eat other mammals . While the number of marine mammals is small compared to those found on land , their roles in various ecosystems are large , especially concerning the maintenance of marine ecosystems , through processes including the regulation of prey populations . This role in maintaining ecosystems makes them of particular concern as 23 % of marine mammal species are currently threatened .   Marine mammals were first hunted by aboriginal peoples for food and other resources . Many were also the target for commercial industry , leading to a sharp decline in all populations of exploited species , such as whales and seals . Commercial hunting lead to the extinction of † Steller 's sea cow and the † Caribbean monk seal . After commercial hunting ended , some species , such as the gray whale and northern elephant seal , have rebounded in numbers ; conversely , other species , such as the North Atlantic right whale , are critically endangered . Other than hunting , marine mammals can be killed as bycatch from fisheries , where they become entangled in fixed netting and drown or starve . Increased ocean traffic causes collisions between fast ocean vessels and large marine mammals . Habitat degradation also threatens marine mammals and their ability to find and catch food .

It is best known for its very slow rate of development . It was once estimated that it had a 14-year lifecycle from egg to adult moth , unique among the Lepidoptera with the ability to withstand temperatures below − 60 ° C . The larvae degrade their mitochondria in preparation for overwintering and resynthesize them in the spring , and each instar of the caterpillar takes about a year . Subsequent studies have revised the lifecycle duration to be 7 years .   The Arctic woolly bear caterpillars are unique in their combination of adaptations to the polar extremes . They spend nearly 90 % of their lives frozen and only about 5 % feeding on the tundra during June ; the remainder is spent in summer aestivation within hibernacula ( protective cocoons ) .   Hiding within hibernacula serves several functions : protection from insect parasitoids that kill about 75 % of the larvae and pupae , avoidance of secondary metabolites built up in their food source , the Arctic willow , degradation of mitochondria linked to hypometabolism and antifreeze synthesis , and conservation of energy reserves needed to synthesize cryoprotective compounds required for freezing survival .   Two insect parasitoids attack woolly bear moth caterpillars : an ichneumonid wasp ( reported as Hyposoter pectinatus but probably Hyposoter deichmanni ) and a tachinid fly ( Exorista thula ) . The wasp , a solitary parasitoid , kills about 20 % of the third and fourth instars of the host while the gregarious bristle fly causes about 50 % mortality in the instar 5 and 6 , and pupae .   The extreme winter temperatures are not as detrimental to Gynaephora caterpillars as are the parasitoids . The larvae are extremely freeze-tolerant , able to survive temperatures down to -70 ° C . As temperatures decrease during the late arctic summer , the larvae start synthesizing cryoprotective compounds , such as glycerol , in addition to some unusual ones , e.g. betaine . Accumulation of these `` antifreezes `` is aided by bottle-necking of oxidative phosphorylation through mitochondrial degradation . The woolly bears resynthesize the mitochondria the following spring upon resumption of their activity .   The Natural History Unit of the BBC filmed arctic woolly bear moths in their natural habitat on Ellesmere Island during June 2009 . The sequence became part of the BBC 's sequel to Planet Earth called Frozen Planet , broadcast on BBC One in autumn 2011 ( with the US broadcast following on Discovery Channel in spring 2012 ) .\"},\n",

On March 24 , 2014 , the secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization Michel Jarraud announced that `` many of the extreme events of 2013 were consistent with what we would expect as a result of human-induced climate change '' .\"},\n",

The global warming also causes thermal inertia , thermal expansion of the oceans , which contributes to sea level rise .

BBC Radio commentator Peter Day referred to him as `` one of the great pioneer environmentalists . ''   Brown is the author or co-author of over 50 books on global environmental issues and his works have been translated into more than forty languages . His most recent book is The Great Transition : Shifting from Fossil Fuels to Solar and Wind Energy ( 2015 ) , in which he explains that the global economy is now undergoing a transition from fossil and nuclear energy to clean power from solar , wind , and other renewable sources . His previous book was Full Planet , Empty Plates : The New Geopolitics of Food Scarcity ( 2012 ) .   Brown emphasizes the geopolitical effects of fast-rising grain prices , noting that `` the biggest threat to global stability is the potential for food crises in poor countries , '' and one that could `` bring down civilization . '' In Foreign Policy magazine , he describes how the `` new geopolitics of food '' has , in 2011 , already begun to contribute to revolutions and upheaval in various countries .   The recipient of 26 honorary degrees and a MacArthur Fellowship , Brown has been described by the Washington Post as `` one of the world 's most influential thinkers . '' As early as 1978 , in his book The Twenty-Ninth Day , he was already warning of `` the various dangers arising out of our manhandling of nature ... by overfishing the oceans , stripping the forests , turning land into desert . '' In 1986 , the Library of Congress requested his personal papers noting that his writings `` have already strongly affected thinking about problems of world population and resources , '' while president Bill Clinton has suggested that `` we should all heed his advice . '' In 2003 he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto .   In the mid-1970s , Brown helped pioneer the concept of sustainable development , during a career that started with farming . Since then , he has been the recipient of many prizes and awards , including , the 1987 United Nations Environment Prize , the 1989 World Wide Fund for Nature Gold Medal , and the 1994 Blue Planet Prize for his `` contributions to solving global environmental problems . '' In 1995 , Marquis Who 's Who selected Brown as one of its `` 50 Great Americans . '' He was recently awarded the Presidential Medal of Italy and was appointed an honorary professor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences . He lives in Washington , D.C. and retired in June 2015 .\"},\n",

It mostly threatens the parasite and pathogen species that are highly host-specific to critically endangered hosts . When the last individuals of a host species are captured for the purpose of captive breeding and reintroduction programs , they typically undergo anti-parasitic treatments to increase survival and reproductive success . This practice may unintentionally result in the extinction of the species antagonistic to the target species , such as certain parasites . It has been proposed that the parasites should be reintroduced to the endangered population . A few cases of conservation-induced extinction are known to have occurred in parasitic lice .'},\n",

This resulted in major food shortages across the Northern Hemisphere .   Evidence suggests that the anomaly was predominantly a volcanic winter event caused by the massive 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in the Dutch East Indies ( the largest eruption in at least 1,300 years after the extreme weather events of 535 -- 536 ) , perhaps plus the 1814 eruption of Mayon in the Philippines . The Earth had already been in a centuries-long period of global cooling that started in the 14th century . Known today as the Little Ice Age , it had already caused considerable agricultural distress in Europe . The Little Ice Age 's existing cooling was aggravated by the eruption of Tambora , which occurred during its concluding decades .\"},\n",

In the spring it thaws out and emerges to pupate . Once it emerges from its pupa as a moth it has only days to find a mate .   In most temperate climates , caterpillars become moths within months of hatching , but in the Arctic the summer period for vegetative growth -- and hence feeding -- is so short that the Woolly Bear must feed for several summers , freezing again each winter before finally pupating .
